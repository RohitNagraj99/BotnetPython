# PythonBotnet
A botnet script created in Python

## Understanding
This is a python script that provides certain functions to create and manage a botnet.
You need to know the public IP, username and password of a user to add that system to your botnet.
Once the bot is added, you can issue commands to all the bots in the botnet at once.
SSH works out of the box on Linux and Unix systems. But a custom server would be needed on a 
windows machine. Thus, its easier if your client has  *nix system.
